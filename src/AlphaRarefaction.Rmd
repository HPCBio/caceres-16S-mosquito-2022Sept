# Alpha rarefaction

```{r, include=FALSE}
# at some point this should be moved into bookdown
source("~/research/biotech/young-chae_kim/2021-Fall-Microbiome/src/common_code.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

```{r}
physeq.filtered <- readRDS('~/research/biotech/young-chae_kim/2021-Fall-Microbiome/results/physeq.filtered.RDS')
```

Let's check whether we're adequately capturing diversity.  This is a simple alpha rarefaction curve; here we want to see the number of taxa plateau as the counts increase.

```{r, include=FALSE}
p <- suppressMessages(ranacapa::ggrare(physeq.filtered, step = 1000,
            color = "Strain",
            label = "Sample",
            se = FALSE,
            plot = FALSE,
            ))
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
p + ggtitle("Alpha Rarefaction")
p
```

Promising differences between strains.

```{r}
p <- p + facet_wrap(~Sex) + ggtitle("Alpha Rarefaction by Sex")  # theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.2))

ggplotly(p)
#ggsave("alpha-rarefaction-byTreatment-separatedbyTreatment.pdf", path = "./results/final-plots", device = pdf, width = 7.5, height = 5, units = "in")
```
