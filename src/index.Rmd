# Introduction

This workbook describes the analysis of microbiome samples from mouse fecal samples. The experimental design includes 4 treatments (Amoxicillin, Clindamycin, Lolamycin, Vehicle), 4 time points (Day 0, 7, 10, & 31), and 6 replicates of each treatment X day. The goal is to study the antibiotic effects vs. vehicle (control) over time.
